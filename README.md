# 🏠 2020 Housing Market Data Story

This project analyzes the U.S. housing market in 2020 through interactive data storytelling using **Tableau** and **Excel**. It was created as part of my coursework in **INST462: Data Visualization** at the University of Maryland.

The project visualizes key housing trends during the early pandemic period and synthesizes insights from five major housing market reports. It aims to uncover how market dynamics shifted in response to economic and social factors, particularly the onset of COVID-19.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Analyzed **900+ U.S. housing records** from 2020 to highlight trends in prices, demand, and sales volume.
- Created an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visually explore the evolving landscape of the housing market.
- Integrated findings from **five expert housing reports** into a cohesive narrative.
- Published a blog post titled **"A Quick Look into the Housing Market"** summarizing key findings and their implications.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – For interactive dashboard creation
- **Microsoft Excel** – For data cleaning and preparation
- **Qualitative synthesis** – To integrate market research into the analysis

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Demand Surge:** In 2020, historically low mortgage rates and remote work trends spurred a spike in housing demand.
- **Price Growth:** Median list prices rose sharply due to limited inventory and competitive bidding environments.
- **Buyer Behavior:** Homebuyers began prioritizing suburban areas and larger spaces amid pandemic restrictions.
- **Inventory Imbalance:** Supply couldn't keep up with demand, causing persistent pressure on prices.
